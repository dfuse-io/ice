## Signing With Scatter

#### Download Scatter 11.0.1

If you don't have Scatter installed, grab the version for your platfrom from the [release page](https://github.com/GetScatter/ScatterDesktop/releases/tag/11.0.1).
Once installed, you'll need to create a passphrase for your wallet. 

Once set up, click Networks in the left hand menu.
Add custom network and enter this info:

Save the new network. 

Now go to the Wallet tab in the menu.

If you already had your key within Scatter, you should see it listed there and now showing with your new account name under it, with the ice network in grey just below that.
